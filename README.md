# Project Name

This repository contains an application that uses pixi for package management.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you need to have the following installed:

- [pixi](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/overview)

After installation, you may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

## Setting Up and Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install dependencies with pixi**

   Pixi uses a `pixi.toml` file to define project dependencies. Install all dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pixi install
   ```

   This will read the `pixi.toml` file and install all required packages into an isolated environment for the project.
